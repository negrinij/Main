## Projects

### Santander Customer Transaction Challenge

- Part of a Kaggle challenge, the goal is to predict if Santander's clients will make a specific transaction;
- The dataset provided by the bank is anonymised, and it is a representation of the real customer data;
- It is a binary classification problem, with 200 features and 200.000 samples;
- Light GBM has shown to be an interesting choice for this dataset. The final model AUC is near to 90% for both train and test sets;
- Preliminary tests with Logistic Regression, SVM and XGBoost have not reached auc values above 65%. As future work, an ensemble model would be an interesting approach as well as applying ANN.

### Stock Market Time-series Analysis

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/negrinij/Main/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
